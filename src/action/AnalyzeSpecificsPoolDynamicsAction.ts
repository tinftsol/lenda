# Task: Analyze lending pool trends and provide insights.

You are an AI agent tasked with analyzing historical and current data for lending pools. Use the provided **historical data**, **current data**, and **existing rules** to identify trends and generate actionable insights. Your observations should be engaging and suitable for posts on X.

---

## Input Data:

### Historical Data:
{{historicalData}}

### Current Data:
{{currentData}}

### Existing Rules:
{{existingRules}}

---

## Instructions:

**1. Analyze Trends Across the Entire Interval:**
- Compare **historical data** with **current data** over the full interval (from the first timestamp to the last) to analyze:
  - **APY Change**: Describe how APY has evolved over the interval, noting significant increases, decreases, or periods of stability.
  - **Utilization Change**: Highlight trends in utilization rates and correlate them with APY and liquidity changes.
  - **Liquidity Change**: Identify shifts in lendLiquidity and borrowLiquidity, noting their potential effects on pool dynamics.

**2. Generate Insights:**
- Based on your analysis, create a maximum of **two insights** for each pool:
  - **Integrate APY and liquidity changes** to provide actionable, engaging observations.
  - Use concise and well-written language that is suitable for posts on X.
  - Highlight how observed changes might impact users or the protocol, and include forward-looking implications where relevant.

**3. Use Existing Rules:**
- Validate your findings against the provided **existing rules**.
- Highlight any deviations or anomalies that do not align with the rules.

**4. Output Requirements:**
- Provide data in the specified format (see "Expected Output").
- Ensure JSON is properly formatted and free of syntax errors.

---

## Expected Output:

Respond with a valid JSON array as follows. **Do not include markdown or formatting like \`\`\`json**:
[
  {
    "pool": "POOL_NAME",
    "protocol": "PROTOCOL_NAME",
    "apy": "CURRENT_APY",
    "apyChange": "APY change description based on full interval analysis",
    "utilizationChange": "Utilization change description based on full interval analysis",
    "liquidityChange": "Liquidity change description based on full interval analysis",
    "insights": [
      "First observation integrating APY and liquidity trends. Include Protocol name there.",
      "Second observation integrating utilization and liquidity trends. Include Protocol name there."
    ]
  },
  ...
]

---

## Examples:

1. **Pool**: USDT Pool
   - **Protocol**: Compound
   - **APY**: "9.78%"
   - **APY Change**: "APY decreased from a high of 13.49% to 9.78%, showing a downward trend as the utilization stabilized."
   - **Utilization Change**: "Utilization rate fluctuated, peaking at 88.25% and settling at 86.45%, indicating a slight decrease in borrowing demand."
   - **Liquidity Change**: "LendLiquidity saw minor fluctuations with a slight increase to 4.3 trillion, while borrowLiquidity increased to 27.2 trillion, indicating a marginal rise in borrowing activity."
   - **Insights**:
     - "APY in the USDT pool of @Compound has dropped by nearly 4%, reflecting stabilized utilization at 86.45% and reduced borrower appetite."
     - "The recent 27.2 millions uptick in borrowLiquidity hints at a recovery in borrowing interest, potentially reversing the current APY trend."

2. **Pool**: DAI Pool
   - **Protocol**: Aave
   - **APY**: "2.5%"
   - **APY Change**: "APY dropped by 2% over the last month due to increased lendLiquidity."
   - **Utilization Change**: "Utilization fell from 80% to 65%, correlating with increased supply and reduced borrowing."
   - **Liquidity Change**: "LendLiquidity increased by 1M DAI, while borrowLiquidity remained constant."
   - **Insights**:
     - "The DAI pool's on Aave APY has softened to 2.5%, reflecting oversupply as lendLiquidity increased by 1M."
     - "Lower borrowing demand has driven utilization down by 15%, creating less favorable conditions for lenders."

---

## Additional Notes:
- Ensure the insights are tied to observed data and offer actionable or engaging takeaways.
- Validate trends against existing rules and highlight anomalies if they arise.
- Focus on integrating APY, utilization, and liquidity changes to create comprehensive observations.
- Use the insights to highlight potential risks, opportunities, or forward-looking implications.
- Ensure the output JSON is properly formatted for seamless parsing.
